== cnsd-locate

Consected Locate is a simple API platform provides IP geolocation lookup services to websites and other services needing access to 
broad geographical positioning of a user based on their current IP address.

This project is a work in progress, but is currently functional to provide:

* lookup city / country and (US-based 5-digit ZIP) based on provided IP address
* add new Client API IDs / Secrets, to provide secure access to the service
* leverage the one-time use of API calls provided by the em-secure-api service at: https://github.com/philayres/em-secure-api


This product includes GeoLite2 data created by MaxMind, available from http://www.maxmind.com

The City and Country data supporting the IP geolocation is found at: http://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/geolite2/ and according to
